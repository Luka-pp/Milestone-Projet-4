## User Experience

## UX 5 Planes

### Strategy Plane
Goal of the website was to create a fully functional e-commerce application
while showcasing the Django Frameworks. This application showcases all the amazing features
that Django Frameworks can offer. Users have opportunity to log in, register and make their
profiles with information that will make their checkout in future easier.
Blog feature adds a new dimension to the application. With blog customers can interact with 
one another. This can also serve as a good indication to the shop owner to see the demand for certain plants.
Store owners can also get a feedback from customers which can then improve their service.
