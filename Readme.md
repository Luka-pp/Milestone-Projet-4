# Majestic Plants


For my **Milestone Project 4** on **Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development** course I have created a
e-commerce website for selling plants. Majestic Plants is a start-up company 
which is specializing in sales of healthy and unique plants. There is also some
of the crowd favorites in there!

## Who is this application for?

This application is for all the plant lovers ot there. It is designed to be user friendly and that 
anyone can go ahead and get that plant they really want. It is also designed
for the store owner who wants to start his new business and is and is a huge fan 
of plants!

## What does it do?

Store owner can display his plants and offer them to the customers to buy. 
Plants are presented in all of their glory and the customer knows exactly what they are getting.
Checkout and payments are done in a hassle-free way so that everyone has a pleasant experience.
Delivery can be provided for a small fee and **Majestic Plants** are **delivering worldwide!**


## User Experience

## UX 5 Planes

### Strategy Plane
Goal of the website was to create a fully functional e-commerce application
while showcasing the Django Frameworks. This application showcases all the amazing features
that Django Frameworks can offer. Users have opportunity to log in, register and make their
profiles with information that will make their checkout in future easier.
Blog feature adds a new dimension to the application. With blog customers can interact with 
one another. This can also serve as a good indication to the shop owner to see the demand for certain plants.
Store owners can also get a feedback from customers which can then improve their service.

### Scope Plane
Based on the requirements of achieving user's and owner's goals and stories, here is the list of required  
 features and functions. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functions are implemented on the website 
as it is required for owners product management.

- simple and effective landing page with call-to-action button.
- Products app shows all the available products which are presented in a well-structured and appealing way
- Sorting products in main navigation is available and helpful for the user to filter out exactly what he/she wants

is not approved it will not be displayed.

Comments are approved in Django's admin console.


### Surface Plane

Website has been designed with the focus on the product.
Throughout the website black and white colours interchange and the first thing that is vibrant 
are the products pictures. As this website is selling plants I wanted to focus fully on the 
amazing colours and patterns mother nature is presenting us with.

#### Typography

The font has been acquired from **Google Fonts**, and to suit the overall looks of the website
**Teko** font has been used in black and white color.

### Skeleton Plane

This website is designed to be used on all the screen sizes.

## Testing

Testing has been done and documented
in [Testing.md](link here)

## Version Control

### Git and GitHub

I used **[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)** as a local repository and IDE
and **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** as a remote repository. The process of version control was:

* First I created a new repository on GitHub
* I have then connected my GitHub account and my PyCharm IDE
* I have then opened that repository in PyCharm and started coding
* In PyCharm I have created all the pages and folders
* I was then saving my work and pushing it to GitHub repository to keep it safe
* Process for saving, committing and pushing it to remote repository goes as follows:
* In the main window of PyCharm click on **Git**
* On drop down menu click on **Commit**
* The commit interface will open on the left side and after adding the commit message click on commit in the left bottom
  corner
* Work is now committed to the master branch
* To push that commit to the **GitHub** I clicked on **Commit and Push** button in the same window
* On click on **Commit and Push** button the pop-up window will show where I needed to confirm that I want to push the
  work to my GitHub repository

## Deployment

This project requires back-end technologies, so for the deployment [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) was used. 
**Heroku**, a cloud platform where users can host their projects. This platform offers free sand paid service. For
the purpose of this project free version was enough. **PostgreSQL** database was selected from
free Heroku addons. For hosting of static files and media files **AWS** S3 bucket was used on a free plan.

Heroku setup:
- Creating account on **Heroku**
- Creating new app by clicking on *New* and then *Create new app*
- Type in the unique name on the app and choose a region closest to us for deployment
- Provision **PostgreSQL** database from heroku add-ons

Steps to be taken before deployment:

- installing **dj_database_url** and **psycopg2-binary** via **pip** from PyCharm terminal
- Connecting local database to **PostgreSQL** by changing ``DEFAULT_DATABASE`` with **database URL** from Heroku and running migrations on our project
- importing all the fixtures by running commands **python manage.py loaddata categories** and **python manage.py loaddata products**
- creating **superuser** by running **python manage.py createsuperuser**
- instilling **unicorn** via pip which will act as our webserver
- **Requirements.txt** file created using **pip freeze > requirements.txt**. This file contains all the necessary dependencies so Heroku can have them ready for the project
- **Procfile** this file contains necessary details about the project so that heroku know what and where is he deploying and in
      which programming language
- temporarily disable ``collectstatic``
- adding host name of our Heroku app to ``settings.py``

Before enabling automatic deploys, Config Vars have to be set as [this](https://github.com/Luka-pp/Milestone-Projet-4/blob/master/Testing%20and%20Readme%20media/Images/heroku_config_vars.png) image indicates
**Settings**.
When all the hidden variables done, click **Enable Automatic Deploys** and click **Deploy Branch*
- Once app deploys the confirmation message will be shown


## Database
During the development **sqlite3** database was used which is installed with **Django**.
For deployment(production), a PostgreSQL database is provided by Heroku as an add-on.

Fixtures for the products are taken from the **Code Institute** course material and manually altered
to fit this project. 

Fixtures are then loaded into the database via **CLI** from the **Pycharm**.
Using the command **python manage.py loaddata categories** to first load the categories for the products
as they are needed for the products fixture. 

Products are then loaded using command **python manage.py loaddata products**. 

After running necessary **migrations** basic products and categories are loaded into database.
